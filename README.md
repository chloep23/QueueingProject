# QueueingProject - Class Ranking 

### Note the Following: 
- All of the code must be written in Java.
- If code from an online resource, apart from the textbook, is used, properly cite and credit the source.
- For full credit, all code must be properly indented.
- Unless otherwise stated, all classes, methods, and complex commands should be commented. Include a comment block at the top of the code with the “Author”, “Date”, and “Purpose”. 
- The 6 methods listed in the ArrayList Class on the Java Quick Reference sheet must be called in the code.
  1. int size() 
  2. boolean add(E obj)
  3. void add(int index, E obj)
  4. E get(int index)
  5. E set(int index, E obj)
  6. E remove(int index) 
- There must be some project design document.
- No lines of code may exceed 120 characters.
- Submission: The final project should be submitted as plain text in the mySTA dropbox by 2022, April 15th.

### Project:
- Briarwood High School has a class ranking system that lists the top students of every grade who have unweighted GPAs of at least 3.70. Every quarter the list is updated and anyone who wishes to access the list can choose to sort it either alphabetically (by last name) or numerically (according to GPA). 
- Currently, the Briarwood High School juniors have completed their second quarter and their class ranking needs to be altered. 
- Given the first-quarter ranking and a list of the 45 juniors with their updated GPAs, alter the queue accordingly.
- Allow students to input his/her name and provide the option to choose between the two sorting methods listed above. 
- Print the new list, the percent of all juniors who made the GPA requirement, and whether the inputted student made the class ranking. If so, additionally return the student’s rank along with his/her unweighted GPA.
